Hello! This post is more of a test run. I have just begun using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and Markdown and want to make sure (through this post) that I'm doing everything right. I presumed the procedure would be pretty complicated. I'm glad to say that is not the case!

I have wanted to create my own website for a while now, I am not quite sure of what I'd like to include in it. I suppose I'll have to decide over time. I'm sure I'll come up with something interesting.

Stay tuned!
