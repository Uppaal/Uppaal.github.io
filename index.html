	<p align="justify">I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Goldman Sachs CoreAI, where I work on information extraction from text in the financial domain. I recently completed my Masters in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>, where I worked in the <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/">Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab</a> under <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof Andrew McCallum</a>, and in the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home/?_ga=2.117104198.155534692.1602819880-1170722050.1601252246">Information Fusion Lab</a> under <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfiterau/">Prof Madalina Fiterau</a>. My primary area of interest lies in developing algorithms in domains with low supervision, and making neural networks learn meaningful representations algined with human understanding. To this end, I have delved into Transfer Learning, Domain Adaptation, Few Shot Learning, Active Learning and the open ended world of Interpretability. Apart from this, I have worked on Deep Learning applied to NLP and Vision tasks, and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. </p>

	<p align="justify">I like to spend my free time reading anything under the sun, singing or playing my violin. I am also an amateur nature photographer, and never miss an opportunity to capture a nice shot. I have also taken up figure skating recently, and it is quickly becoming one of my favourite sports!</p>
