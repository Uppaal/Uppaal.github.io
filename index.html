	<p text-align="justified">I am a second year graduate student of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>. My primary area of interest lies in core Deep Learning problems, and Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on Natural Language Generation, and Object Tracking and Classification; I have thoroughly enjoyed my exposure to these areas so far, and look forward to delving into these fields into greater depth. </p>

	<p text-align="justified">A vast array of DL tasks require data which isnâ€™t readily available, and requires tedious dataset generation and annotation. Hitting such roadblocks myself has piqued my interest in Transfer Learning; To this end I have worked on Few Shot Learning, using Active Learning as a method of Transferring knowledge across domains, and using GANs as a tool for dataset augmentation.</p>

	<p text-align="justified">I like to spend my free time reading anything under the sun. I also enjoy singing and playing my violin. I am an amateur nature photographer, and never miss an opportunity to capture a nice shot. I have also taken up figure skating recently, and it is quickly becoming one of my favourite hobbies!</p>
