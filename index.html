	<p text-align="justified">I am a first year graduate student of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>. My primary area of interest lies in core Deep Learning problems, and Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on Natural Language Generation, and Object Tracking and Classification; I have thoroughly enjoyed my exposure to these areas so far, and look forward to delving into these fields into greater depth. </p>

	<p text-align="justified">A vast array of DL tasks require data which isnâ€™t readily available, and requires tedious dataset generation and annotation. Hitting such roadblocks myself has inspired me to explore Generative Models for data augmentation, and the wider areas of Transfer Learning and Semi Supervised Learning.</p>

	<p text-align="justified">I like to spend my free time reading anything under the sun. I also enjoy singing and playing my violin. I am also an amateur nature photographer, and never miss an opportunity to capture a nice shot.</p>
