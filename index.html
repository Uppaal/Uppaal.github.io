	<p align="justify">I am a second year graduate student of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>, working in the <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/">Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab</a> under <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof Andrew McCallum</a>. My primary area of interest lies in core Deep Learning problems, particularly solving the problem of data dependence in Deep Learning. I have delved into Transfer Learning, Domain Adaptation, Few Shot Learning and Active Learning. I have also worked on Deep Learning applied to NLP and Vision tasks, and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. </p>	
		
	<p align="justify">I spent the past summer working with the Platform division at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html">Goldman Sachs</a> on Anomaly Detection, and had a wonderful experience. Before that, I spent an exciting semester collaborating with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/">Microsoft Research, Montreal</a>, where I worked on Transfer Learning for Machine Comprehension, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tihazen/">TJ Hazen</a>. I briefly worked with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/">Prof Erik Learned-Miller</a> on an interesting project on Intelligent Search for agents using visual aids. I was introduced to the world of Machine Learning under the wonderful guidance of <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/">Prof Balaraman Ravindran</a> at IIT Madras, where I worked on Object Tracking and Classification. 
		
	<p align="justify">I like to spend my free time reading anything under the sun. I also enjoy singing and playing my violin. I am an amateur nature photographer, and never miss an opportunity to capture a nice shot. I have also taken up figure skating recently, and it is quickly becoming one of my favourite hobbies!</p>
