	<p align="justified">I am a second year graduate student of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>. My primary area of interest lies in core Deep Learning problems, particularly solving the problem of data dependence in Deep Learning. A vast array of DL tasks require data which isnâ€™t readily available, and requires tedious dataset generation and annotation. Hitting such roadblocks myself has piqued my interest in Transfer Learning; To this end,  I have worked on Few Shot Learning, using Active Learning as a method of Transferring knowledge across domains, and using GANs as a tool for dataset augmentation.</p>
		
	<p align="justified">I am also interested in Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have worked on Natural Language Generation, Coreference Resolution, and Object Tracking and Classification; I have thoroughly enjoyed my exposure to these areas so far, and look forward to delving into these fields into greater depth. I also spent the past summer working with the Platform division at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html">Goldman Sachs</a> on Anomaly Detection, and had a wonderful experience.</p>

	<p align="justified">I like to spend my free time reading anything under the sun. I also enjoy singing and playing my violin. I am an amateur nature photographer, and never miss an opportunity to capture a nice shot. I have also taken up figure skating recently, and it is quickly becoming one of my favourite hobbies!</p>
