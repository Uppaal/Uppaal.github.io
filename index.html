<!-- 	I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Goldman Sachs Research, where I work on ... -->
<!-- 	focus is on solving tasks with minimum human supervision by incorporating priors -->
	<p align="justify">I recently completed my Masters in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>, where I worked in the <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/">Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab</a> under <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof Andrew McCallum</a>. My primary area of interest lies in developing algorithms in domains with low supervision. To this end, I have delved into Transfer Learning, Domain Adaptation, Few Shot Learning and Active Learning. Apart from this, I have worked on Deep Learning applied to NLP and Vision tasks, and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. </p>

	<p align="justify">I like to spend my free time reading anything under the sun. I also enjoy singing and playing my violin. I am an amateur nature photographer, and never miss an opportunity to capture a nice shot. I have also taken up figure skating recently, and it is quickly becoming one of my favourite hobbies!</p>
