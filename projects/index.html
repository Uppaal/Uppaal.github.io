	<h2>Transfer Learning for Question to Answer Ranking Problems in New Domains</h2>
	<p><i>New project: More updates soon!</i></p>
	<p>Recent advances in deep learning techniques for machine reading comprehension and question answering have dramatically improved the performance of question answering technology on open-ended questions. These techniques answer questions by identifying snippets or sections of text from a larger document (or document collection) where the extracted text contains an explicit answer to the question posed.  While building a general purpose question answering model is an excellent long-term goal, there are many real world scenarios in which building a domain-dependent model is sufficient. However, there is often only a limited amount of in-domain data to train from in each new domain. In this scenario, it may be possible to apply transfer learning to adapt either a general purpose model, or a domain-dependent model from a similar domain, to produce an effective model for the new domain.</p>
 	<p>This project aims to explore the use of transfer learning in the context of a question to answer ranking system for identifying the best answers for technical questions that have been posed to Stack Overflow. The data set consists of original question and answer pairs collected by Stack Overflow for a variety of technical subject areas. The training data also includes many examples of "duplicate" questions posed to Stack Overflow,  i.e., questions for which an answer in a pre-existing Q&A pair can be used to answer the equivalent "duplicate" question. For transfer learning, a smaller collection of Q&A pairs in a new domain which can be used for transfer learning to the new domain, shall be used. The new model will be evaluated by measuring its effectiveness of matching new "duplicate" questions to the pre-existing Q&A pairs in the new domain.</p>

	<h2>Combating Unbalanced Datasets with Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19u5PwBdRXN6555aIIx0LgTeysS_bwTT5/view?usp=sharing">PDF</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Uppaal/GANs_for_data_augmentation">Code</a></p>
	<p>Data is a highly important factor in Deep Learning. The presence of a large, labeled and balanced dataset is often essential for a model to perform optimally at a particular task. However, finding such data in the real world is rare, and creating these datasets is a tedious task.</p>
	<p>The aim of this project is to overcome one of the aspects of difficulties with datasets: unbalanced data across different classes. In more detail, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used on an existing unbalanced dataset to create synthetic data of
the lesser represented classes. To my best knowledge, GANs have never been used for this purpose before. </p>
	<p> Using Deep Convolutional GANs after pretraining the Discriminator on the dataset gave promising results which surpassed the baseline method and almost matched the original dataset.</p>

	<h2>Character Identification in Multi-party Dialogue settings using Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lNwmw11_yHtDL3asdmdHZ2N5xtAzo5ZB/view?usp=sharing">PDF</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Uppaal/multiparty_dialogues_entity_linking">Code</a></p>
	<p>Character Identification an entity linking task, where each Mention, or a nominal referring to a person, is mapped to its respective Entity, or character of the dialogue. Our work evaluates the current state of the art method of Character Identification in a multiparty setting. The architecture of this methodology uses the Agglomerative-CNN which creates clusters of mentions using their embeddings and features related to information about the context, gender and plurality of mentions. These unlabelled clusters are linked to their respective entities using a simple feed forward architecture. Using word and sentence embeddings generated by transferring knowledge from a separately trained neural model boosted the performance of the model by almost two percent. While our model does not equal the model paper percentage, we found this method to create a significant improvement over our implementation of the model paper.</p>

	<h2>Using Region based Convolutional Neural Networks to create a system to detect, track and classify vehicles from video footage.</h2>

	<p>Rich real-time traffic data is being obtained using advanced sensors such as Video and GPS as well as communication technologies at a data centre in the Intelligent Transportation Systems laboratory. This data offers tremendous scope to investigate empirical patterns. The focus of this work is to mine this data to derive empirical understanding and develop models towards this broad goal. Specific focus areas include: quantification of the ITS data to investigate the role of various sources that affect system performance (demand, incidents, weather, construction, special events, control devices etc.) and applying this knowledge towards the development of algorithms for optimizing and improving system performance. The project aims to utilize, use deep learning techniques to detect, track and classify vehicles, in real-time, into numerous categories from the video footage of the roads, thus utilizing the traffic data to identify and gauge the levels of traffic at intersections and roads throughout the city of Chennai.</p>
	<p>As an alternative method of creating a system robust to occlusion and varying illumination changes, I proposed the idea of using infrared radiation to track and published my proposed method on <a href="http://www.ijrat.org/downloads/ncpci2016/ncpci-02.pdf">Exploring Robust Vehicle Detection and Tracking Methods for Various Illumination Settings using Infrared Thermographic Images</a>.
