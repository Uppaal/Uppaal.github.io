	<h2>Combating Unbalanced Datasets with Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19u5PwBdRXN6555aIIx0LgTeysS_bwTT5/view?usp=sharing">PDF</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Uppaal/GANs_for_data_augmentation">Code</a></p>
	<p>Data is a highly important factor in Deep Learning. The presence of a large, labeled and balanced dataset is often essential for a model to perform optimally at a particular task. However, finding such data in the real world is rare, and creating these datasets is a tedious task.</p>
	<p>The aim of this project is to overcome one of the aspects of difficulties with datasets: unbalanced data across different classes. In more detail, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used on an existing unbalanced dataset to create synthetic data of
the lesser represented classes. To my best knowledge, GANs have never been used for this purpose before. </p>
	<p> Using Deep Convolutional GANs after pretraining the Discriminator on the dataset gave promising results which surpassed the baseline method and almost matched the original dataset.</p>

	<h2>Character Identification in Multi-party Dialogue settings using Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lNwmw11_yHtDL3asdmdHZ2N5xtAzo5ZB/view?usp=sharing">PDF</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Uppaal/multiparty_dialogues_entity_linking">Code</a></p>
	<p>Character Identification an entity linking task, where each Mention, or a nominal referring to a person, is mapped to its respective Entity, or character of the dialogue. Our work evaluates the current state of the art method of Character Identification in a multiparty setting. The architecture of this methodology uses the Agglomerative-CNN which creates clusters of mentions using their embeddings and features related to information about the context, gender and plurality of mentions. These unlabelled clusters are linked to their respective entities using a simple feed forward architecture. Using word and sentence embeddings generated by transferring knowledge from a separately trained neural model boosted the performance of the model by almost two percent. While our model does not equal the model paper percentage, we found this method to create a significant improvement over our implementation of the model paper.</p>

	<h2>Using Region based Convolutional Neural Networks to create a system to detect, track and classify vehicles from video footage.</h2>

	<p>Rich real-time traffic data is being obtained using advanced sensors such as Video and GPS as well as communication technologies at a data centre in the Intelligent Transportation Systems laboratory. This data offers tremendous scope to investigate empirical patterns. The focus of this work is to mine this data to derive empirical understanding and develop models towards this broad goal. Specific focus areas include: quantification of the ITS data to investigate the role of various sources that affect system performance (demand, incidents, weather, construction, special events, control devices etc.) and applying this knowledge towards the development of algorithms for optimizing and improving system performance. The project aims to utilize, use deep learning techniques to detect, track and classify vehicles, in real-time, into numerous categories from the video footage of the roads, thus utilizing the traffic data to identify and gauge the levels of traffic at intersections and roads throughout the city of Chennai.</p>
	<p>As an alternative method of creating a system robust to occlusion and varying illumination changes, I proposed the idea of using infrared radiation to track and published my proposed method on <a href="http://www.ijrat.org/downloads/ncpci2016/ncpci-02.pdf">Exploring Robust Vehicle Detection and Tracking Methods for Various Illumination Settings using Infrared Thermographic Images</a>.

	<h2>Facial Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/Uppaal/Projects/blob/master/FER/Project%20Report.pdf">PDF</a></p>
	<p>Created a Facial Expression Recognition system using vanilla Convolutional Neural Networks, for automatically identifying the condition of patients in hospitals. The model was aimed to be computationally inexpensive, to enable real time tracking through video.</p>
