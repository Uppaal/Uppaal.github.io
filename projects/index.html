	<h2>Combating Unbalanced Datasets with Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19u5PwBdRXN6555aIIx0LgTeysS_bwTT5/view?usp=sharing"><h4>PDF</h4></a> | <a href=""><h4>Code and Results</h4></a>
	<p>Data is a highly important factor in Deep Learning. The presence of a large, labeled and balanced dataset is often essential for a model to perform optimally at a particular task. However, finding such data in the real world is rare, and creating these datasets is a tedious task.</p>
	<p>The aim of this project is to overcome one of the aspects of difficulties with datasets: unbalanced data across different classes. In more detail, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used on an existing unbalanced dataset to create synthetic data of
the lesser represented classes. To my best knowledge, GANs have never been used for this purpose before. </p>
	<p> Using Deep Convolutional GANs after pretraining the Discriminator on the dataset gave promising results which surpassed the baseline method and almost matched the original dataset.</p>

	<h2>Character Identification in Multi-party Dialogue settings using Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>

	<p>Character Identification an entity linking task, where each Mention, or a nominal referring to a person, is mapped to its respective Entity, or character of the dialogue. Our work evaluates the current state of the art method of Character Identification in a multiparty setting. The architecture of this methodology uses the Agglomerative-CNN which creates clusters of mentions using their embeddings and features related to information about the context, gender and plurality of mentions. These unlabelled clusters are linked to their respective entities using a simple feed forward architecture. Using word and sentence embeddings generated by transferring knowledge from a separately trained neural model boosted the performance of the model by almost two percent. While our model does not equal the model paper percentage, we found this method to create a significant improvement over our implementation of the model paper.</p>
